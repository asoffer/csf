This was a project I undertook while an undergrad at KU under the direction of Dr. Jeremy Martin. The goal was to test Richard Stanley's conjecture that the chromatic symmetric function (CSF) is an isomorphism invariant for trees. Jeremy and colleagues cite in [1] the results of Li-Yang Tan, who showed that trees with <= 23 vertices have different CSFs using a brute-force search. Unfortunately, his code is no longer available.

I've extended Tan's results to trees with <= 25 vertices, and also made my code freely available on Github.

Calculating the chromatic symmetric function of a graph is computationally expensive. However, for trees, I have implemented a number of optimizations that make computing and comparing the CSFs feasible (even at n=25, where there are ~104 million trees to search through, see http://oeis.org/A000055). Additionally, much of the computation is done in parallel. See the cpp_code folder for details.
